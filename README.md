Create to a conversion table using the following format:
    C= (F32) / 1.8;
Start with Fahrenheit temperature of 20 degrees and end with a temperature of 120 degrees; use an increment value of 5.  The table will have two columns, one for Fahrenheit and one for those same temperatures converted to Celsius.
